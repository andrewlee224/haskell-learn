# haskell-learn
Scratchpads / exercises created while learning Haskell

Mostly from book "Learn yourself a Haskell for a great good". Most snippets are not exercises, but examples from the book. I just try to write/solve the example by myself first (based of preceding description) instead of just copying it straight from the book. That's why some code might be very slightly different than one from the book - if I used a slightly different syntax to achieve the same goal"
